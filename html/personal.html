        <p class="card--paragraph">

          When I first got to Princeton, I definitely felt imposter syndrome. I looked around me and saw people who built robots, ran companies, started nonprofits, and even worked for the White House. It was definitely a shock to be surrounded by such brilliant and accomplished people. If I’m being honest, I felt a little out of place. That feeling hasn’t gone away but has definitely diminished these past few months. Settling into my classes, joining extracurricular activities, and achieving on an academic level helped me prove to myself that I do belong here. <br><br>

One piece of advice that I would give to anyone struggling with imposter syndrome is to give yourself time; don’t expect to achieve from the get-go. Celebrate your wins and give yourself credit for them. You worked hard and you do deserve to be here.<br><br>

Another piece of advice I have is to remember that almost everyone around you feels–or has felt–imposter syndrome. I felt lonely in that experience until I started sharing how I was feeling and discovered that my friends were going through the same internal struggle that I was. <br><br>

        <h1 class="card--topic">I'm always tired but never sleeping...</h1>
          <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/sleep.jpg" />
        <p class="card--paragraph">
          During high school, getting enough sleep during a busy week was never my strong suit. Amid all the responsibilities and expectations I set out for myself, sleep seemed like the least important thing.
<br><br>
This habit of cutting down on my hours of sleep to prioritize work has only worsened at Princeton, where the workload is not only heavier but also more difficult. During the first few weeks, my sleep schedule seemed not to be adversely affecting me. However, after a while, I caught myself falling asleep during lectures, which was unprecedented for me. Then there were days where I was glued to my chair for several hours on end and still failed to get everything done because I was so drained from the lack of sleep.
<br><br>
I am committed to taking small and incremental steps to adjust my sleep schedule. Instead of stubbornly finishing an assignment, I go to bed when I realize I have been working on it for too long.
<br><br>
When I have a few hours between classes, I take power naps. Gradually, I have noticed that I am able to focus better in lectures and get more work done in a shorter amount of time. I believe that sleep should be non-negotiable no matter how busy you are and I am working hard every day to live by that philosophy.

        <h1 class="card--topic">What to do when your physical AND mental health are tanking?</h1>
          <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/phys_mental health.jpg" />
        <p class="card--paragraph">
          It is hard to take care of your physical health with so many other things on your plate at Princeton. I know that has been true for me. Between clubs, classes, and all of the other commitments that come with being a Princetonian, it may seem impossible to find the time to exercise, focus on mental health, or even get enough sleep.
<br><br>
I still struggle with this, but I have been able to make some headway on the physical and mental health front: I have dedicated once a week to doing yoga. At home, I found yoga to be a wonderful respite from the daily hustle and a great way to move my body and stretch. When I got to school, that practice fell away.
I was so caught up with work that I failed to make time for something so beneficial to my health. Upon reflecting and realizing this, I made a concerted effort to reintroduce yoga into my life. I found a yoga partner and we set aside one hour each week on Thursdays to the practice.
<br><br>
Having that set time and someone else to keep me honest, I have stuck to my goal. My biggest piece of advice is to realize that you can almost always do things if you schedule them. You have more time than you realize.

        <h1 class="card--topic">What the HELL do I do when I graduate?</h1>
          <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/after princeton.jpg" />
        <p class="card--paragraph">
          Many upperclassmen friends always joke about how freshmen are overly preoccupied with their career paths. Nevertheless, for me, the fear of having absolutely no idea what my life will look like after graduation is very real: Do I want to go grad school? Will I be better off gaining some real work experiences first? Should I do that in my home country?<br><br>
           Whenever my mind ventures into this unknown territory, I always find more questions than answers, self-doubt than reassurance. This uncertainty also comes in the way of finding opportunities that are supposed to align with my future path: how am I supposed to apply to internships if I have no idea what I want to ultimately pursue? That was when I realized I needed some advice from adults who went through the same feelings when they were in my position and would sympathize with my concerns. <br><br>
           I scheduled my first, and then second appointment with the Center for Career Development. Even though I still have a lot of questions that only time will allow me to find satisfactory answers to, after conversations with those advisors, I have realized that uncertainty is part of the process. What is the fun in always knowing what the next steps will be? That does not sound like an exciting Princeton adventure to me! <br><br>

        <h1 class="card--topic">What to do when you feel like you're failing your religion?</h1>
          <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/religion.jpg" />
        <p class="card--paragraph">
          So you feel like you are failing in the religious realm of your life. I’ve been there.
  <br><br>
  My thinking about my religious practice has evolved significantly over the past year and a half during and after my gap year program in Israel. During my time there, I realized that Jewish law is multi-layered, complex, and lengthy; there are simply so many laws.
  <br><br>
  The only people who can accumulate a majority are great biblical, Talmudic scholars and Rabbis. I didn’t fully grasp how little I knew until I delved into my classes. When I did, I had somewhat of a religious crisis, realizing that I had been doing a lot of things wrong my entire life and that I was unlikely to ever be able to follow the letter of the law perfectly.
  <br><br>
  That thought led me to strive for perfection (despite knowing that it was impossible). The fear of failure lurking around every aspect of legal observance began to take away the meaning of the practices themselves. By trying to strive toward perfection and avoid failure, I found myself straying further and further away from genuine spiritual connection and fulfillment.
  <br><br>
  However, I soon came to realize that striving toward technical perfection wasn’t going to get me anywhere. All I could do was to keep learning and pouring myself into spiritual and religious observance. I keep trying to get better every day–to pray each morning, keep the laws that I have learned, and gradually find meaning in my religious practices.
  <br><br>
  My advice to you for navigating religious failure (if you can even call it that) is to practice-self compassion first and foremost. Spirituality and religious observance are not easy. I would also say to focus on small incremental changes that you are likely to stick to. For me, that was pledging to take the time to pray each morning. I have recently added a new commitment: joining a weekly Jewish learning session on the Torah portion each week.

        <h1 class="card--topic">So you’re a perfectionist  </h1>
          <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/perfectionism.jpg" />
        <p class="card--paragraph">
          Hardworking. Meticulous. Bright. Doubtful of your abilities despite a trophy case of accomplishments. Motivated by the need to avoid failure. Does any of that resonate with you? If so, you are likely what Martin Covington would call an overstriver.
<br><br>
Throughout high school, I was definitely an overstriver. I was terrified of failure, so I avoided it...by succeeding. My goal was to get accepted into Princeton, and–in my mind–that meant that I had to be perfect in every facet of my academic life.
<br><br>
I believed that if I failed, I was a failure. I turned the verb (FAIL) into a noun (FAILURE). Even minute, everyday failures, seemed cataclysmic. It was only during my gap year did my perspective begin to shift: I started to truly value the content of my learning. There were no grades.
<br><br>
I was learning purely for the sake of learning and I loved it. Now, I see my education in a very different light than I did in high school. I am really engaging with the material I am learning. That is not to say that I have completely overcome perfectionism - far from that.
<br><br>
I just try my best to shift my perspective when I am doing work. Instead of being hyper focused on output, when I am studying I try to remember what it was that sparked my interest in taking that class in the first place. That often helps alleviate the stress and put things in perspective.

        <p class="card--paragraph">
          So you’re in front of your notebook, pen ready, but inspiration hasn’t received your invitation. Or you are before the canvas, brushes washed, palette clean, but no direction. Or about to belt out the final notes of an aria and can’t quite get them right.
<br><br>
Sarah Kaufman, a dance critic for the Washington Post said that: “the worst type of failure is boredom.” Her words really speak to me as a poet. What makes me proud of my poems is their honesty and vulnerability. I don’t hold anything back from the page. I let thoughts and ink meld together. I have had pieces that I have gotten stuck on and it is usually because I am not surrendering to the emotion behind my work. Once the floodgates open, inspiration usually follows.
<br><br>
When you feel like an artistic failure, try to take a step back and draw from the depth of the creative soul within you. Draw from your raw emotions and genuine life experiences. That has made all the difference for me and I hope it will for you too. <br><br>
