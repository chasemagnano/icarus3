      “Weird question,” I asked my friend. <br>
“What is it?,” he asked me.<br>
I hesitated. “Have you ever got a bad grade here?”<br>
“Hmmm…honestly, no.”<br><br>

While I laughed it off, his response really got to me. Questions began swirling around my head. Am I the only one who is struggling here? Is Princeton only hard for me because I am incapable?<br><br>

Even though the fact that I made it to Princeton should be enough to prove otherwise, I still experienced feelings of self-doubt knowing that some of my friends are not struggling as much as I am.<br><br>

These feelings persisted until I talked to more people and realized that I was succeeding in a lot of things that they did not; we were excelling–and failing–in different realms so I couldn't compare our journeys. Having this realization helped me see that success and failure at Princeton are not binary.
<br><br>
One may succeed in one aspect of life but fail in another, and I can say with absolute certainty that every single Princeton student will be able to find at least one area in which they are uniquely competent. It is important, however, to remember that this may take time. As you go on your own journey at Princeton, try exploring a variety of classes and clubs until you find something that you are truly passionate about, and change the perspective whenever you are disheartened by a failure. One failure will not define you. What defines you is how you deal with the failure and come back from it. Do you wallow and stall out? Or do you examine what led to the failure and plan a path forward?<br><br>

      <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/eating club.jpg" />
    <p class="card--paragraph">
      At a quick glance, Eating Clubs dominate the social scene. Each Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, everyone announces which club they’re on the list for, ready to celebrate the end of the week. Especially as a freshman, these lists can feel impossibly hard to get on. It’s hard enough to meet upperclassmen, now add in the challenge of convincing them to put your name on one of their coveted list slots. <br><br>

The truth is there is so much more to a social life than the few list-only eating clubs on the weekend. PUID nights are some of the most fun because they’re sure to be packed out and many foster a more chilled out vibe for those looking for it. Additionally, other clubs provide entertainment on weekend nights: from acapella arch sings to Campus club to club social events, there is a lot to do even once you leave the Street. <br><br>

For many students though, going to Prospect Ave is an integral part of their college experience. If you’re struggling to find list spots available, first try simply making friends with upperclassmen. Even better than just getting on the list, many times, they will offer you a spot to a night out because they just want to get to know you better as a friend. Try joining recreational clubs and taking the extra step out of your comfort zone to meet new people.

  <h1 class="card--topic">Hold on. Who am I actually?</h1>
    <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/who am I.jpg" />
  <p class="card--paragraph">
    Back in high school, I felt as though I had a pretty clear idea of who I was and what my interests were. I was a student-athlete, spending the majority of the school year training when I wasn’t studying and spending summers traveling to tournaments and camps throughout the country. I, like many others I’ve talked with, built most of my identity off of two things: school and athletics. So, when I decided to come to Princeton knowing I wouldn’t be pursuing an athletic career anymore, I found myself completely lost.
    <br><br>

Although it might sound silly to some, I had never known how different it was to be a student versus a student athlete. I was used to a routine, used to the lifestyle, and used to being recognized as an athlete.  When I stepped onto Princeton’s campus and my identity was no longer tied to my sport, I was terrified. When people asked me what my interests were and what I did for fun, I had no idea anymore. Moreover, I had no idea what I wanted to study. I had always leaned towards English and History more than math and science, but I wasn’t so sure anymore. Essentially, I had no clue who I was outside of sports.
<br><br>

I’ve talked with so many others who have had similar experiences whether it is with a sport, an instrument, art, etc. It is not at all an uncommon experience, but it can feel incredibly isolating. Surrounded by so many people who seem like they know what they like and what they want to do, it is easy to feel behind or like you’ve failed in some way.
<br><br>

I often think of myself as a blank canvas. I have all of my materials: I still know who I am at my core. I know what my values are, the people I love, the type of person I want to be etc. I don’t have anything painted yet though. I’m still figuring that all out. Some people I’ve met seem to have their painting completely finished, while others have about half of it done, and many have just a few parts completed. We’re all at different stages. Keep reminding yourself that you will figure it out. There is plenty of time to explore options and you have complete freedom to be whoever you would like. You don’t have to go apply to all of these different clubs or have a fully figured out and prominent social life. We are enough just as we are without all of the flashy accolades. It is okay to be a blank canvas and it is okay to take your time painting.

  <h1 class="card--topic">All My Friends Are in My Res College
</h1>
  <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/res college.jpg" />
  <p class="card--paragraph">
    During the first few weeks of school, I thought that I was going to be able to maintain all the friendships I had made during orientation. I thought that as long as I made enough effort, I could balance everything and see everyone consistently. This was not the case by any means. <br><br>

I’ve found that it can be pretty tough to hang out with friends who are not in the same residential college as me, especially since I don’t have any classes with them. When I was swamped with coursework, juggling extracurriculars, and trying to sneak in some naps whenever possible, I found it was easier to just grab dinner with my friends from my res college and hang out in their dorm room rather than hike all the way across campus. Before I knew it, it had been weeks since I had hung out with anyone outside of my res college. <br><br>


I absolutely love my friends in Forbes, but I felt like a failure as a friend overall. I wanted to make sure I was branching out and keeping in touch with my other friends, but found it often slipped my mind as I hung out with them less and less. Now, it’s winter, and it’s freezing. I have a hard time convincing myself there is any reason to leave Forbes after dark. <br><br>


I’ve come to realize that it is almost impossible to see everyone consistently. There are going to be times when you hang out with certain people almost every day and then sometimes you’ll go a whole week without seeing them. Everyone is living such busy lives that it is extremely difficult to coordinate everything. This doesn’t mean that you’re any less of a friend, as long as you still show them that you care about them and you make an effort. Time spent with a person doesn’t always equate to how strong that friendship is.
<br><br>

Also, remind yourself that you’re going to make new friends depending on what classes you take, what clubs you join, and sometimes completely out of the blue. This doesn’t make your old friends any less important. Maybe all of your friends are in the same college or maybe none of them are, and either is completely okay. Don’t be too hard on yourself! Just make sure to show the people you care about that they are important to you.

  <h1 class="card--topic">Where have you been all week? When you fail to make time for your friends.
</h1>
  <img class="card--avatar" src="../images/where have u been all week.jpg" />
  <p class="card--paragraph">
    Finals season is upon us and that means papers are nearing their due dates and exams are on the horizon. With so much on my plate, I have found myself rushing around from class to study sessions to Firestone with no break in between. It has been really difficult for me to make time for the important relationships in my life. This past week, I felt like I didn’t see my close friends. Many people asked me where I had been all week. That made me pause and reevaluate the way I was functioning. I was failing to prioritize the people I cared about. Something had to change. I have been making an effort to schedule in time with friends. I planned a coffee with a friend for tomorrow morning and I have scheduled lunches and dinners with friends so that I make sure to see them. I am going to eat anyhow, so I might as well kill two birds with one stone. If you are feeling overwhelmed in the academic realm and see it affecting the social sphere of your life, know that you are not alone. Make the effort to schedule a meal with a friend. That one small act can make all the difference.
